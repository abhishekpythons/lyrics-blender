00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:26,014
We were young

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,309
Posters on the wall

11
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,610
Praying We are the ones

12
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:30,111
That the teacher 
wouldn't call

13
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:33,108
We would stare at 
each other

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,509
'Cause we were 
always in trouble

15
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:36,916
And all the cool kids

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,201
Did their own thing

17
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,914
I was on the outside

18
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:41,103
Always looking in

19
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,708
Yeah‚ I was there
but I wasn't

20
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:46,913
They never really cared 
if I wasn't

21
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,616
We all need that someone

22
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,713
Who gets you
like no one else

23
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:57,154
Right when you
need it the most

24
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:00,517
We all need 
a soul to rely on

25
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:03,200
A shoulder to 
cry on

26
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:07,717
A friend through the 
highs and the lows

27
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,606
I am not gonna 
make it alone

28
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:10,517

Your forgiving eyes

41
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:34,202
Looking back at me

42
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:35,505
From the other side

43
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,508

44
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:41,307
